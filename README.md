# Overview

This [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) launches all services in Confluent Platform and runs them in containers in your local host, enabling you to build your own development environment. Specifically, this also builds out everything required for the GeoDemo..
You can reach the Control Center UI at localhost:9092 and the GeoDemo at localhost:8080 (or the respective hostname)
