  "description": "This repo has a demonstration of the KSQLGeo UDF.  The data comes from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) which publishes  information updated on a minute basis.  This demonstration provides a node.js script that queries the REST API CTA  provides and publishes it into Kafka.  That data will then be pre-processed in KSQL to transform it slightly and enrich  with a geo hash.  One of the transformations is to speed the timeline up 10X since minute upates are rather slow.  The  geo hash is calculated using the geo_hash() UDF function.",
